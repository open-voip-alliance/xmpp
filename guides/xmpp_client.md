# Using your own XMPP client
There are [lots of XMPP clients](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html) to choose from, and everyone has their own favorite. To keep it short we will not cover the use of every client, but will provide the basic settings you need in order to register an account on our XMPP server.

## Server settings
Host: `openvoipalliance.org`

Port: `5222`

In-band registrations are enabled which means you are free to create accounts on our server.
